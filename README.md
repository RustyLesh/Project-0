The twist of this game is: Killing the enemy will result in the boss becoming harder to kill. 

There is be a currency, levels, shops, and inventory system so the players can get stronger by buying upgrades and items.

This game is heavily inspired by Metal Slug. An arcade game made in the 90â€™s by the Japanese game company SNK.
